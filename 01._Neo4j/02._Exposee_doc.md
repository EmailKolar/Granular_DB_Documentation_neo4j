# Neo4j Access Control Demo

1. Go to (tailscale)[https://tailscale.com/download], and dowload & install
   
3. Message me to get invited to my tailscale network

4. You can run the `tailscale status` command to see if it's running - and that you are connected to my network

1. In your web browser, navigate to:

`url`

---

2. Login with the following credentials:
- **Username**: `matrix_fan`
- **Password**: `neopassword`

---



3. Run the following Cypher query to get a list of all movies in the database:

(paste the command in the top bar where it says "neo4j$", and press the blue triangle in the far right side of the bar)


`
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.title;
`

- **Expected result:** As a matrix_fan user (who has restricted access), you should only see The Matrix listed. All other movies in the database should be represented as null objects.

---------

4. Now, try to add a movie to the database by running the following Cypher command:

`
CREATE (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix 5', released: 2025, tagline: 'Eat The red pill'})
`

- **Expected result:** This should fail, as the matrix_fan role does not have permission to add new data to the database.

--------
 
5. Log out of the matrix_fan user by running the following cypher:

`:server disconnect`

6. Log in with the following credentials:


- **Username**: `movie_admin`
- **Password**: `moviepassword`

------

7. Run the same Cypher query again to get a list of all movies:

`
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.title;
`

- **Expected result:** As movie_admin, you should now see a list of all movies in the database

-----

8. Now, with the movie_admin account, you have permission to add nodes. Try adding a new movie by running the following Cypher query:


`
CREATE (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix 5', released: 2025, tagline: 'Eat The red pill'})
`

- **Expected result:** The query should succeed, as movie_admin has the necessary read and write permissions. Congratulations! You have successfully added a new movie to the database.

------

9. To confirm the movie was added, run the following query:

`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix 5'})
return m`
