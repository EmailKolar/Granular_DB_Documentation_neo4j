Important note - granular acces only available for enterprise version of neo4j

Dev version of enterprise is available for free on the desktop version of neo4j

Cons: 
  Neo4j free version is limited - you have to use desktop version to create roles. 
  Therefore making a docker image and sending that to integrator proved difficult.
  It is an atypical database type comparing to what I am used to.
Pros: 
  Fairly simple to create and alter databases.
  I was able to showcase granular acces control using neo4j.
  Granularity is small (single node)
