Important note - granular acces only available for enterprise version of neo4j

Dev version of enterprise is available for free on the desktop version of neo4j

Cons: 
  Neo4j free version is limited - you have to use desktop version to create roles. 
  Therefore making a docker image and sending that to integrator proved difficult.
  It is an atypical database type comparing to what I am used to.
Pros: 
  Fairly simple to create and alter databases.
  I was able to showcase granular acces control using neo4j.
  Granularity is small (single node)
  
Other:
  free versions of webtunneling does not work to expose a DB as Db uses tcp
  free version of webtunnel software does not support tcp
  As docker did not work with free vers. of neo4j and webtunnel did not work with free vers.
  We had to use tailscale - tailscale worked fine, but downsides are you have to communicate
  a little bit to get connected, which goes against the spirit of the assignment.
  All these factors put together, maybe signals that, for this assignment, neo4j was the wrong choice.
  I however was too stubborn to let it go, and enjoyed the process of trying neo4j.
